Key Responsibilities:

Perform adversarial testing on LLMs, CV, NLP, and GenAI systems.
Simulate and document prompt injection, model evasion, data poisoning, model inversion, and training data leakage attacks.
Lead red teaming on RAG pipelines, vector stores and embedding models.
Evaluate AI safety measures such as guardrails, output filtering, toxicity detectors, and hallucination handling.
Utilize and extend red teaming frameworks like Clade, MCP, Llama Guard, Prompt inject, etc
Design AI threat models using tools such as MITRE ATLAS, OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, and internal abuse taxonomies.
Collaborate with Blue Team, AppSec, and ML teams to improve model robustness.
Contribute to AI security policy, responsible disclosure guidelines, and ethical testing documentation.
Conduct full-scope red team operations, including adversary emulation and assumed breach scenarios.
Perform offensive security assessments across web, Android, Active Directory, internal networks and infrastructure.
Conduct Active Directory attacks, including Kerberoasting, DCSync, DCShadow, NTLM relay, and credential abuse.
Simulate lateral movement, pivoting, and post-exploitation on Windows and Linux infrastructure.
Execute cloud penetration tests on AWS, Azure, or GCP, focusing on IAM misconfigurations, privilege escalation, and insecure services.
Required Skills & Experience:

4+ years of experience in penetration testing, red teaming or offensive security.
1+ years working with AI/ML or LLM-based systems.
Deep familiarity with LLM architectures (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA) and pipelines (e.g., LangChain, Haystack, RAG-as-a-Service).
